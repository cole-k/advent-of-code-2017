# Advent of Code 2017

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2017. Mostly written in Python, though sometimes I'll have a solution in [J](http://www.jsoftware.com/) (the .ijs files).

Files contained in `original/` are the original code I used, or at least pretty close to it.
