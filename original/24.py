# I messed up and didn't save the original for today.
# It's basically the same was part_two for the nice solution except
# without a generator comprehension (I still don't know what I did
# wrong with that) -- I manually added the value to a list and then
# iterated through the list -- and with worse variable names.
# It so happened that I didn't really need to polish my solution.
