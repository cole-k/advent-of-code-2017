# How hexagon grids work

Take a look at the depicted grid.

```
  \ n  /
nw +--+ ne
  /    \
-+      +-
  \    /
sw +--+ se
  / s  \
```

We assign each hexagon an _x_ and _y_ coordinate in Cartesian space. Moving
diagonally moves 1 in each coordinate. However, moving vertically moves 2 in
the _y_ coordinate. Consider the hexagon to the northeast. It is up 1 unit from
the origin. Now consider the hexagon to the northwest of this hexagon. It is up
1 unit from it, so therefore it must be up 2 units from the origin. This
hexagon is the hexagon directly above the origin, ergo, movement directly along
the _y_ axis counts twice.

Here's how to get the shortest path.

First, move diagonally as much as possible. Since moving along the _x_ axis can
only be done diagonally, you _must_ move `x_dist` diagonally. However, now you've
moved `x_dist` in the _y_ direction toward your goal as well.  So you subtract from
your `y_dist` the distance you moved along the _x_ axis (or make it 0 if your
`x_dist` is greater).

Now, move along the _y_ axis. You move 2 spaces at a time
along the _y_ axis, so you divide the remaining `y_dist` spaces you need by 2.

# Afterword

It turns out this isn't perhaps the most intuitive means of working with
hexagons. Check out [this](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)
well-done article on coordinate systems and hexagons. My solution is still
valid, as far as I can tell, but there are different ways to get the same
solution.
